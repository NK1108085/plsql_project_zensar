## Project Description
The **Taxi Reservation System** is a database-driven project designed to manage taxi reservations, customers, and ride durations efficiently. The system ensures accurate tracking of taxi availability, calculates ride costs based on booking durations and distances, and provides insights into frequently booked taxis. 

The system leverages **SQL** and **PL/SQL** to handle complex database operations, ensuring data integrity and consistency across all transactions.

## **Features**
- **Taxi Booking Management**:  
  - Facilitates smooth booking operations for customers.  
  - Tracks real-time taxi availability and updates automatically after bookings.  
- **Customer Data Management**:  
  - Maintains customer details for efficient service.  
- **Ride Cost Calculation**:  
  - Implements PL/SQL functions to calculate ride costs based on booking duration and distance traveled.  
- **Frequently Booked Taxis Analysis**:  
  - SQL queries to identify taxis with the highest demand.  
- **Triggers for Availability Updates**:  
  - Ensures taxi availability is updated automatically after bookings are completed.

## **Technologies Used**
- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)  
  - For database querying and management.  
- **PL/SQL** (Procedural Language/SQL)  
  - For stored procedures, triggers, and complex calculations.

## **Key Database Tasks**
1. **Identify Frequently Booked Taxis**:  
   - SQL queries to generate reports on the most popular taxis in the system.  
2. **Update Taxi Availability**:  
   - Triggers to ensure taxi status is updated automatically post-booking.  
3. **Calculate Ride Costs**:  
   - PL/SQL functions to calculate total charges based on booking duration, distance, and rates.
